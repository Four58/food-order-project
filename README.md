# food-order-project
This is a react project I learned from Udemy. CSS files were provided by my instructor already. 
In this project, I used firebase as my database where I fetch food menu and push orders to. 
You can create your own firebase and replace mine with yours to see how it works. 
This website, the users can add the food to the cart and checkout to confirm their orders and it will be sent to firebase.
